1. My name is Abasiri Somtochukwu Francis matric no 23/1676, i did the db.php part for the shop inventory which is the first part of the work now this handled the critical backend functionality related to managing product data and processing updates within the inventory system. This includes tasks such as adding new products, updating product details, and managing stock quantities. The script also validates inputs to ensure data integrity and interacts with the database to reflect real-time inventory changes, which are essential for accurate sales tracking and reporting.

2. My name is Nwonye Joshua matric no 23/0857, i worked on the index.php part i couldn't push it with my laptop cause mine has issues but i worked on it on my teammates laptop which is somto own, so this file serves as the the main dashboard and user interface for the Inventory and Sales Management system. This page will display an overview of current inventory status, recent sales activities, and key performance metrics. It also includes navigation elements to access different parts of the system such as product listings, sales reports, and user management. The file will integrate the frontend components with backend data, providing users with a smooth and interactive experience to monitor and control inventory operations.

3. My name is Kencharles Onyebuchi with matric no 23/2251, i could not get my laptop to work so i had to use my team leader laptop to developed the add_product.php file and push, so i developed the add_product as a part of the Inventory and Sales Management System to enable the addition of new products to the system’s database. This module allows users (typically admins or inventory staff) to input and register new items into the inventory efficiently and securely.This will help to provide a functional and user-friendly interface for adding new products to the inventory. It ensures that all the essential product information is collected, validated, and securely stored in the database for future use in sales, stock management, and reporting.

4. My name is Jesubanjo Oluwaseun with matric no 23/3802, i worked on the sell_product.php part, this makes it possible to sell an inventory by accessing the add_product.php and with a click on the sell button, it sells the product that appears on the inventory

5. My name is Stephan Nakpodia, with matric no 23/2376 i worked on the summary.php part, this makes it possible to provide a quick overview of the system's key prformance metrics, allowing users(such as managers or admin's) to monitor sales trends, stock levels, and overall business performance in real-time.

6. My nmae is AGBOTIA ONYINYE SIMPHIWE 23/1130 Vxyghn i worked on the style.css part.I Shop Inventory Management System a clean, modern, and responsive look. The design includes a light and dark mode toggle, which allows users to switch themes easily with smooth transitions. I used a centered container with rounded corners, shadows, and soft colors to make the layout look neat and professional.I also styled the forms, tables, and buttons to be consistent and easy to use. The stock levels are color-coded — blue for high stock, pink for medium, and red for low — so users can quickly see inventory status. The page is fully responsive, adjusting well on mobile devices, and I added simple animations to make the interface smoother and more interactive. Overall, I focused on making the design clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

7. my name is Dominic Peace udhedhe 23/2516 Lafrances17, I created the product.sql file to manage and export all product data from my Shop Inventory System. It contains the table structure and records for each product, including the ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity. This file makes it easy to back up or transfer product information to another database.
